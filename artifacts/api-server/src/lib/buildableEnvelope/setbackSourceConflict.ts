/**
 * P-340 — the R-1 conflict row: when the sources that can supply a parcel's
 * setbacks DISAGREE and at least one of them states no readable effective
 * date, both candidates are served and neither is settled.
 *
 * THE RULING THIS IMPLEMENTS. MOST-CURRENT SOURCE WINS (operator 2026-09-11,
 * `_decisions/2026-09-11_setback_source_most_current_wins.md`): "an unreadable
 * date produces a conflict row with both values, never a silent pick."
 * `authoritativeSetbackSource.ts` has RETURNED that conflict since P-154 —
 * `AuthoritativeSetbackResolution.conflict`, every candidate unmodified — but
 * no surface SERVED it: the route's own payload carried `setbackSource` and
 * the served 4-tuple and dropped `conflict` on the floor, so a customer saw
 * one number and no way to learn a second source disagreed. This module is
 * the served shape.
 *
 * WHY IT REUSES THE P-270 VOCABULARY RATHER THAN INVENTING ONE. The vintage
 * question ("could this citation's date be read at source?") and the conflict
 * question ("do two sources disagree?") are two questions about the same two
 * facts, and `setbackCitationVintage.ts` already fixed the vocabulary for the
 * first: `SetbackDateUnreadableState` names WHICH unreadable cause applies,
 * and `SETBACK_CITATION_VINTAGE_UNREADABLE_NOTE` is the one customer sentence
 * for all of them, byte-pinned across hauska-map and legacy-design-tools. This
 * row carries that same `state` member (never a parallel enum) so an
 * instrument switching on the cause reads one vocabulary; the conflict
 * sentence is a SEPARATE pinned literal because it says a different thing
 * (two sources, both served, neither settled) and re-using the vintage
 * sentence for it would tell a customer the vintage is unknown while the real
 * news is that two sources disagree.
 *
 * ONE MODULE, TWO REPOS. hauska-map's copy lives at
 * `apps/property-explorer/api/_lib/setback-source-conflict.ts`. The row shape
 * is structural, not a shared class, so neither repo imports the other.
 *
 * WHAT THE PAIR OF PINS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Each repo's suite pins
 * its OWN copy of the sentence against a literal typed into the same repo. That
 * is a LOCAL pin and an early warning only — it does not by itself catch a
 * one-sided edit whose author also updates that repo's literal, which is
 * exactly the false comfort P-331 corrected in the P-270 pair. The cross-repo
 * half is `scripts/check-cross-repo-literal-drift.mjs` (P-331), which reads
 * both DEFINING modules and compares them byte for byte. It does NOT yet carry
 * a row for this literal — the row is named in P-340's close, to be added once
 * both copies exist on both mains, because a row that reads a file the sibling
 * main does not have yet REFUSES (exit 2) on every PR. Until that row lands,
 * this literal's cross-repo comparison is a NAMED BYPASS of the drift check,
 * not a covered case.
