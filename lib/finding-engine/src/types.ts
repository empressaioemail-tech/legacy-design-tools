 * `artifacts/plan-review/src/lib/findingsMock.ts:39-103` so the V1-6
 * frontend swap collapses to a single re-export change. A typecheck-
 * only equivalence test pins them to the FE mock.
 *
 * The engine returns ZERO OR MORE findings on every successful call:
 * a submission with no compliance issues yields an empty array. The
 * route distinguishes "engine ran cleanly, found nothing" from
 * "engine errored" by reading the run row's `state` (`completed` vs
 * `failed`); the empty-findings list itself is never an error.
