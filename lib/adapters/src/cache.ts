/**
 * Adapter result cache contract — Task #180.
 *
 * The runner stays IO-free (per the comment at the top of `runner.ts`),
 * so this module defines a small interface a caller can implement to
 * back the cache with whatever store fits — the api-server uses a
 * Postgres table (`adapter_response_cache`), tests use an in-memory
 * `Map`.
 *
 * Cache key contract:
 *   - `(adapterKey, latRounded5, lngRounded5)`
 *   - Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimal places (~1.1m at the
 *     equator) so a parcel that geocodes to slightly different
 *     coordinates on a re-run still hits the cache. Anything coarser
 *     would risk crossing parcel boundaries; anything finer wouldn't
 *     coalesce repeated runs against the same parcel.
 *   - Coordinate normalisation is one-shot in {@link toCacheKey} so
 *     producers and consumers cannot drift on the rounding rule.
 *
 * Invalidation: there is no explicit "evict on parcel move" path.
 * Because the key is the parcel's coordinates, a parcel that moves
 * lands on a *different* cache key — the old entry stays put until its
 * TTL elapses, the new entry is fetched fresh. This matches Task #180's
 * "Cache is invalidated when the parcel coordinates change" without
 * needing a sweep.
 *
 * Failure isolation: cache lookups and writes must never throw — the
 * runner treats them as best-effort. A cache implementation that hits
 * a transient DB error should log and return `null` / no-op.
