/**
 * Shared types for state, local, and (future) federal adapters.
 *
 * An *adapter* is a producer that — given a parcel context — fetches one
 * cited overlay layer from a public GIS endpoint (or returns a deterministic
 * "no coverage" verdict) and emits a `briefing-source` row. The api-server's
 * generate-layers route runs an adapter set, isolates per-adapter failures
 * (Spec 51 §4 / DA-PI-2 contract), and writes the successful results into
 * `briefing_sources` keyed by `<jurisdiction-key>:<source-name>`.
 *
 * Drift note (DA-PI-4 recon): DA-PI-2's federal adapter precedent does not
 * exist in this room, so the contract defined here is the canonical one
 * DA-PI-2 should mirror when it lands. The shape mirrors the brief's
 * locked decision #1 ("common interface identical to federal adapters from
 * DA-PI-2") so the downstream wire shape is stable across tiers.
 *
 * Locked decision #3: each adapter's `adapterKey` is the
 * `<jurisdiction-key>:<source-name>` slug (e.g. `ugrc:dem`,
 * `grand-county-ut:zoning`). The runner packs this into the existing
 * `briefing_sources.provider` column rather than introducing a dedicated
 * `adapter` column — DA-PI-3's briefing engine already reads `provider` as
 * the source-attribution pointer, so no schema migration is required.
